# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Visual Studio 2022 extension that provides intelligent code completion and navigation assistance using Ollama AI models. The extension will analyze the user's typing context and cursor position to provide predictive text suggestions and smart cursor jump recommendations in an unobtrusive manner.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Visual Studio 2022, I want the extension to predict what I'm typing based on surrounding code context, so that I can accept helpful suggestions to speed up my coding. 

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types in the Visual Studio editor THEN the extension SHALL capture the configurable surrounding lines of code around the cursor position (based on user settings)
2. WHEN the user continues typing THEN the extension SHALL send the context (including cursor position history if available) plus current typing to an Ollama model for prediction
3. WHEN the Ollama model returns a prediction THEN the extension SHALL display the suggestion in an unobtrusive manner
4. WHEN the user sees a suggestion THEN the extension SHALL allow the user to accept or ignore the recommendation
5. IF the user accepts the suggestion THEN the extension SHALL insert the predicted text at the cursor position
6. IF the user continues typing without accepting THEN the extension SHALL dismiss the current suggestion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to recommend where my cursor should jump to next in the file, so that I can navigate efficiently through my code structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is typing or has completed a code block THEN the extension SHALL analyze the file structure to determine logical next cursor positions
2. WHEN a jump recommendation is available THEN the extension SHALL display a small notification indicating the suggested jump direction (up or down)
3. WHEN the notification shows a downward jump THEN the extension SHALL display the notification at the top of the screen
4. WHEN the notification shows an upward jump THEN the extension SHALL display the notification at the bottom of the screen
5. WHEN the user presses the Tab key (default) THEN the extension SHALL move the cursor to the recommended position
6. WHEN no jump recommendation is available THEN the extension SHALL not display any navigation notifications

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the extension's behavior and key bindings, so that I can customize it to fit my workflow preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses extension settings THEN the extension SHALL provide options to configure the Ollama server endpoint
2. WHEN the user accesses extension settings THEN the extension SHALL allow customization of the jump recommendation key binding
3. WHEN the user accesses extension settings THEN the extension SHALL provide options to configure the surrounding code context (e.g., 2 lines down and 3 lines up)
4. WHEN the user accesses extension settings THEN the extension SHALL allow enabling/disabling of code prediction features
5. WHEN the user accesses extension settings THEN the extension SHALL allow enabling/disabling of cursor jump recommendations
6. WHEN the user accesses extension settings THEN the extension SHALL allow configuration of cursor position history memory depth (e.g., 3 jumps context memory)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to work reliably with .NET Framework 4.7.2, so that it integrates properly with Visual Studio 2022's extension architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is installed THEN it SHALL be built targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2
2. WHEN Visual Studio 2022 loads THEN the extension SHALL initialize without errors
3. WHEN the extension communicates with Ollama THEN it SHALL handle network timeouts and connection failures gracefully
4. WHEN Ollama is unavailable THEN the extension SHALL continue to function without crashing Visual Studio
5. WHEN the extension encounters errors THEN it SHALL log appropriate diagnostic information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension's suggestions to be contextually relevant, so that the recommendations actually help improve my coding efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending context to Ollama THEN the extension SHALL include the user-configured surrounding lines and cursor position history to provide meaningful context
2. WHEN the cursor is at the beginning of a line THEN the extension SHALL consider indentation and code structure in predictions
3. WHEN the cursor is within a method or function THEN the extension SHALL prioritize suggestions relevant to that scope
4. WHEN the user is typing comments THEN the extension SHALL provide comment-appropriate suggestions
5. WHEN the user is typing in different file types THEN the extension SHALL adapt suggestions to the appropriate programming language

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension's interface to be unobtrusive, so that it doesn't interfere with my normal coding workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying code suggestions THEN the extension SHALL use Visual Studio's standard IntelliSense-style presentation
2. WHEN showing jump recommendations THEN the extension SHALL use subtle, non-blocking notifications
3. WHEN the user is not actively typing THEN the extension SHALL not display any intrusive UI elements
4. WHEN multiple suggestions are available THEN the extension SHALL prioritize the most relevant one
5. WHEN the user dismisses a suggestion THEN the extension SHALL not immediately show another suggestion for the same context

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to track my cursor position history across files, so that it can provide more contextually aware suggestions based on my recent navigation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user makes a change in one file and jumps to another file THEN the extension SHALL maintain a history of cursor positions and file changes
2. WHEN the user makes related changes across multiple files THEN the extension SHALL include the context from previous file positions in its analysis
3. WHEN the configured jump context memory is reached (e.g., 3 jumps) THEN the extension SHALL maintain only the most recent cursor positions within that limit
4. WHEN sending context to Ollama THEN the extension SHALL include relevant code snippets from the cursor position history
5. WHEN the cursor position history includes multiple files THEN the extension SHALL intelligently determine which historical contexts are most relevant to the current position
6. WHEN the user clears the workspace or solution THEN the extension SHALL reset the cursor position history
