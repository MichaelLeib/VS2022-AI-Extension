# Resources Directory

This directory contains resource files for the Ollama Assistant Visual Studio extension.

## Required Files

- **OllamaAssistantCommand.png**: Icon bitmap for menu commands (referenced in OllamaAssistant.vsct)
  - Should be a bitmap strip containing 5 icons (16x16 pixels each)
  - Icons for: Toggle, Settings, Manual Suggestion, Clear History, Diagnostics

## Note

The actual PNG file needs to be created by a designer or downloaded from an icon library.
For development purposes, the extension will work without the icon but will show a missing image placeholder.
